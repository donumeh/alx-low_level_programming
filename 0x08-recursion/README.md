## RECURSION

This repository explores the concept of recursion in computer science. Recursion is a powerful programming technique that involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable instances of the same problem. It is a fundamental concept in many programming languages and is widely used in algorithm design.

# What is Recursion?

Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself as a subroutine. It is a way to solve complex problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems. In a recursive function, the function is called with a smaller or simpler input until a base case is reached, which is a condition that terminates the recursion.
