## SINGLY LINKED LIST

This repository contains an implementation of a singly linked list in the C programming language. A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

Insertion: Insert a new node at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the linked list.
Deletion: Remove a node from the linked list by its value or position.
