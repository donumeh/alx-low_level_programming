## MALLOC & FREE

malloc and free are functions in the C programming language used for dynamic memory allocation. They provide a way to allocate and deallocate memory on the heap during the runtime of a program.

# malloc
The malloc function is used to allocate a block of memory of a specified size in bytes. It returns a pointer to the starting address of the allocated memory block if the allocation is successful, or a null pointer if the allocation fails.

# free
The free function is used to deallocate the memory block previously allocated by malloc or other related functions, freeing up the memory for reuse. It takes a pointer to the memory block as an argument and releases the allocated memory.
