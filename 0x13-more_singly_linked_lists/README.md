## Singly Linked List (C)
This repository contains an implementation of a singly linked list in the C programming language. A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

# Features
* Insertion: Insert a new node at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the linked list.
* Deletion: Remove a node from the linked list by its value or position.
* Traversal: Traverse the linked list and print its elements.
* Searching: Search for a specific value in the linked list.
* Length: Get the length of the linked list.
* Reversal: Reverse the order of the elements in the linked list.
