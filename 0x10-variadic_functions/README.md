## VARIADIC FUNCTION - C

A variadic function in C is a function that can accept a variable number of arguments. It allows you to define functions that can take a different number of parameters at runtime. This is particularly useful when you want to create functions that can handle a flexible number of arguments or when you want to provide a generic interface.

# How Variadic Functions Work

Variadic functions in C are implemented using the `stdarg.h` header file, which provides a set of macros and functions to handle variable argument lists. The key macros defined in `stdarg.h` are:

* `va_list`: This is a type that holds the information necessary to iterate through the variable arguments.
* `va_start`: This macro initializes the `va_list` object to point to the first variable argument.
* `va_arg`: This macro retrieves the next argument from the variable argument list, using the type specified.
* `va_end`: This macro cleans up the `va_list` object after you are done accessing the variable arguments.
